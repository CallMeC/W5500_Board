# W5500 Breakout Board
The purpouse of this project is to offer an Ethernet connectivity to poor microcontrolers through SPI interface.
Many board exists for this purpouse, unfortunately they are all RJ45 dependent. For some application it can be usefull to have a twisted pair Ethernet, not dependant on connectors.
This board has 2 twisted pairs for output.
It is meant to be powered through 5V DC supply. It also has 2 level shifters, making it compliant with 5V logic MCUs.
